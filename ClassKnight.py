"""
Backtracking is a brute force algorithm that utilizes dynammic programming to be faster
than pure brute force. It tries legal, possible moves at random when it reaches a dead - end,
it will backtrack to the previous and try another move. The function will never choose that move again
from that square since all possible combination from the move led to a dead end.

Example of Backtracking:
You are stuck in a maze and trying to get out. You go down a certain path but it leads to a dead end.
You backtrack to before you entered the path and then,
You mark that path with a rock so you do not go down that path again, because you know it will not lead
to the exit.

Example of Brute Force:
You have 10 coins, 2 quarters, 2 pennies, 4 dimes, and 2 nickels. Find what combination leads to 7 cents
In Brute Force, you find all possible combinations of the coins.
Then you see which combination led to 7 cents which is 1 nickel and 2 pennies.
